# Append to secondary in a sensible way.  That is:
#
# • If secondary is empty, “replace” the empty secondary with standard
#   in.
# • Else if secondary is non-empty, append.
#
# Workaround for a bug (in my opinion) in `xsel`: if secondary is empty,
# `--append` causes a segfault and secondary is not populated with
# content.
