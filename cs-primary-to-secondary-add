# Append the content of primary to secondary.
#
# Secondary is treated like a list which elements are inserted from
# primary.  The elements inserted by this script are separated by the
# character `\x1F` (Unit Separator).  The separator cannot appear in the
# incoming primary selection.  This is unlikely to happen since `\x1F`
# is an ASCII control characte.

# `cs-stack-secondary-pop` pops the values inserted with this script.
