* DONE fix scripts that use ~--append~

    `aux-secondary-append` is the only script which uses `--append`.
These scripts will not function correctly if the thing that is appended
to (primary, secondary, or clipboard) is empty.  This is due to a (in my
opinion) bug in ~xsel(1)~.

* DONE Use Perl and ~split()~ to implement parsing

    See r#a19a87d1ee3b (“Populate secondary”, 2019-03-24).
Use Perl and ~split()~ to implement parsing of the contents of
primary/secondary/clipboard.

See: http://www.perlmeme.org/howtos/perlfunc/split_function.html

* On that ~No newline at end of selection~ behavior
