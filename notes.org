* TODO fix scripts that use ~--append~

These scripts will not function correctly if the thing that is appended
to (primary, secondary, or clipboard) is empty.  This is due to a (in my
opinion) bug in ~xsel(1)~.

* TODO Use Perl and ~split()~ to implement parsing

Use Perl and ~split()~ to implement parsing of the contents of
primary/secondary/clipboard.

See: http://www.perlmeme.org/howtos/perlfunc/split_function.html

* On that ~No newline at end of selection~ behavior
